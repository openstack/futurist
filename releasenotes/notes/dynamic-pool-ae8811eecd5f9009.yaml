    Adds a new ``DynamicThreadPoolExecutor`` that can resize (grow or shrink)
    its pool based on demand. As new work is scheduled on the executor, it will
    try to keep the proportion of busy threads within the provided range
    (between 40% and 80% by default).

    The motivation is to provide a scalable alternative to
    ``GreenThreadPoolExecutor``.
